Technical information documenting the Banjo-Tooie EEPROM data storage.
Compiled by Iconoclast.
Note:  This is not a user's manual!  See the MANUAL help text for help
       with program usage.  This file is for bit-wise documentation.

Let `global_data` be a pointer to one of two 256-byte chunks of EEPROM.
The first possibility is EEPROM + 0x000; the second is EEPROM + 0x080.

Rareware seems to like alternating and swapping which one's the valid
block and which one's not to throw people off examining changed bit
properties in a hex editor.  The way to tell which one the game will
read from next time is simply by reading the very first byte.

if (EEPROM[0x080] == 0x08)
    global_data == EEPROM + 0x080;
else
    global_data == EEPROM + 0x000;

Everything else from EEPROM[0x100] to EEPROM[0x7FF] is all stuff used by
the game save files' progress when playing the game normally.

Let `game` be a pointer to one of four 448-byte chunks of EEPROM.
The four possibilities are:
  * EEPROM + 0x100
  * EEPROM + 0x2C0
  * EEPROM + 0x480
  * EEPROM + 0x640

Although there is enough space for four game save files, there are only three
which can actually be accessed through the game.  The fourth is used for
swapping with the last-updated game save file and destroying the old copy in an
attempt to break save editors or views in a hex editor.  The first 64-bit block,
from game[0x000] to game[0x007], is destroyed to 0 when updating a game save
file over to a fourth, backup slot.

The 8-bit octet at game[0x00A] stores what game save file number the data is
for (either 0x01, 0x02, or 0x03).

Since these chunks of data are so much larger to explore, what has been found
about them is essentially covered in the C source code to the save-editing
application.  A shameless dump of unused notes that didn't make their way into
the save editor follows:

game[0x0E5] |= 0x01; /* Klungo defeated */
game[0x0E9] |= 0x80; /* met the fish under the boulder */
game[0x0C6] |= 0x10; /* mayahem honeycomb */
